# Week 5 exercise

## Q1.1 
- No problems stand out particularly but the per base sequence and per seqeunce GC are not favorable in the beginning of the sequence 
- The reason for poor quality at the beginning of the sequence could be that the signaling sequence at the start is too strong for the machine to recognize due to the limits of sequencing technology causing the beaginning of the sequences to be unreliable. 

## Q1.2 
- The most overrepresented sequence in the sample is the serine proteases coding genes of the drosophila
- It makes sense since serine proteases are important in helping digestion thus it is heavily represented in the drosophila gut 

## Q2
- 25 samples 
- The triplicate samples are extremely similar to each other in every way which suggest the high consistency between the replicates.

## Q3.3 
- The Fe_1 and LFC-Fe_3 label could be reversed since Fe_1 is grouped with LFC-Fe while LFC-Fe_3 is grouped with Fe. 

## Q3.6
- Yes it makes sense since most of the enrichment can be seen in metabolic pathways which matches with our samples coming from the midgut tissues.
