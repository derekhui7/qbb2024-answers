# Week10 Exercise 

## Q3.1 
- The nascent RNA signal identifies the amount of nascent RNA in the nucleus in a cell which help indicate real time active transcription activity 
- The PCNA signal identifies the amount of PCNA in the nucleus. As a cell proliferation indicator, it reflects DNA replication and repair activity
- Ratio of the two identifies the active transcription of RNA to DNA replication which help indicate a relationship between the two 

## Q3.2 
- SRSF1 has the highest ratio, it is an RNA binding protein that involves in alternative splicing, thus SRSF1 knockdown could result in previous nascent transcripts not being spliced thus leading to them being recognized as actual nascent transcripts leading to the increased amount of signals causing the ratio to increase as numerator increases. 
- APEX1 has the lowest ratio, APEX1 is heavily involved in DNA repair, thus its knockdown could result in significnat amount of DNA damage. This phenomenon will increase PCNA signal, thus lowered the ratio as the denominator increases.
