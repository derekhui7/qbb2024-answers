# Week 2 Exercise 

## Q2.3 
1. The exons see a drastic dip in enrichment as the MAF increases as shown in the plot compared to all other features 
2. MAF (minor allele frequency) is the value of the frequency of the second most prevalent allele in the population. As MAF increases, it represents that the population that either represent the most prevalent or the second most prevalent allele increases thus suggesting a decreasing amount of other allele present in the population thus causing enrichment to decrease.
3. Yes, since exons are the only coding feature while introns, other, and cCREs are noncoding. The relative levels of the noncoding features are quite similar while the exons see a significant drop in enrichment as MAF increase which may suggest that because of their crucial role in translation that they have less variability.
